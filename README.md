SIH 25006: Development of a Digital Farm Management Portal for implementing Biosecurity measures in Pig and Poultry Farms

## Problem Description

### Background

Biosecurity is a cornerstone of animal health management, particularly in the pig and poultry sectors, where disease outbreaks such as Avian Influenza and African Swine Fever can cause significant economic losses, threaten food security, and disrupt rural livelihoods. Despite its importance, many farmers—especially smallholders in resource-limited areas—struggle to access practical, actionable information on biosecurity protocols, risk assessment tools, and regulatory compliance requirements.

### Problem Description

There is an urgent need for a user-friendly, digital platform that empowers farmers to implement, monitor, and sustain robust biosecurity practices on their farms. This portal should offer end-to-end solutions for farm-level biosecurity management by integrating:

• Customizable risk assessment tools based on local epidemiological conditions.
• Interactive training modules and best practice guidelines tailored for pig and poultry production systems.
• Compliance tracking features aligned with regulatory frameworks to help farmers work toward disease-free compartment recognition.
• Real-time alerts and monitoring dashboards for disease outbreaks and biosecurity breaches.
• Multilingual and mobile-first design to ensure accessibility in remote and rural areas.

The platform should also enable data collection and analysis for policy support, foster collaborative networking among stakeholders (farmers, veterinarians, extension workers, etc.), and promote long-term resilience and sustainability in the livestock sector.

### Expected Outcomes

• Enhanced farmer awareness and education on biosecurity.
• Improved risk management at the farm level as well as self-assessment.
• Easy access to customized biosecurity protocols and guidelines.
• Digital record-keeping and compliance tracking.
• Timely alerts and disease notifications to farmers.
• Healthier livestock and increased farm productivity.
• Empowerment of small and marginal farmers with limited resources.
• Support to authorities in data-driven surveillance and policy making.
• Stronger collaboration across the livestock ecosystem.
• Improved national preparedness for zoonotic and transboundary diseases.

## Problem Creater's Organization

Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying

## Theme

Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying (DoAH&D)

## Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is a comprehensive **Digital Farm Biosecurity Management Portal** designed to support pig and poultry farmers with real‑time tools, educational resources, and risk‑monitoring capabilities. The platform integrates modern digital technologies to streamline farm operations and ensure strong biosecurity compliance.

### 1. Detailed explanation of the proposed solution

The system will offer farmers a centralized online dashboard equipped with modules such as:

* **Biosecurity Risk Assessment Wizard** – evaluates farm hygiene, entry protocols, animal movement, and environmental conditions.
* **Digital Farm Logbook** – stores vaccination records, feed schedules, visitor logs, and sanitation routines.
* **Disease Alert & Notification Engine** – provides real‑time alerts based on local epidemiological data.
* **Interactive Training & Certification** – self‑paced learning modules available in vernacular languages.
* **Compliance Monitoring Tool** – automatically checks adherence to national biosecurity standards.

### 2. How it addresses the problem

The portal directly tackles the lack of structured biosecurity knowledge and monitoring tools by:

* Providing **easy‑to‑follow guidelines** customized to each farm.
* Enabling **continuous tracking** of critical biosecurity indicators.
* Facilitating **early detection** through real‑time alerts and event monitoring.
* Reducing dependency on external inspections by digitizing on‑farm assessments.
* Allowing small farmers to make informed decisions backed by data.

### 3. Innovation and uniqueness of the solution

* **AI‑assisted biosecurity scoring** tailored to farm type and region.
* **Geo‑mapped disease tracking** for quick risk prediction.
* **Multilingual support** for wider adoption in rural India.
* **Offline‑sync mobile app** for farms with limited internet access.
* **Role‑based access** allowing vets and authorities to collaborate efficiently.

## Technical Approach

### 1. Technologies to be used

* **Frontend:** React.js / Flutter (for mobile‑first design)
* **Backend:** Node.js / Django REST API
* **Database:** PostgreSQL / MongoDB
* **AI & Analytics:** Python (Scikit‑learn), TensorFlow Lite
* **Cloud Deployment:** AWS / Azure
* **Integrations:** GIS mapping APIs, SMS gateway, Push notification services

### 2. Methodology and process for implementation

* Requirements gathering from farmers, vets, and field officers
* System architecture design and API modeling
* Development of risk‑assessment engine and training modules
* Integration of analytics, alert systems, and cloud services
* UI/UX optimization for multilingual mobile accessibility
* Testing with real‑world farm scenarios
* Deployment and user onboarding

## Feasibility and Viability

### 1. Analysis of the feasibility of the idea

* High feasibility due to increasing smartphone adoption among farmers
* Government interest in digital livestock monitoring systems
* Scalable cloud‑based architecture supports large user numbers

### 2. Potential challenges and risks

* Limited digital literacy among rural farmers
* Poor internet connectivity in remote areas
* Ensuring accuracy of farmer‑entered data

### 3. Strategies for overcoming these challenges

* Provide vernacular training videos and voice‑assisted navigation
* Offline mobile mode with periodic data sync
* Field demonstrations and support from veterinary officers

## Impact and Benefits

### 1. Potential impact on the target audience

* Farmers gain improved disease preparedness and safer livestock environments
* Veterinary officers can monitor farm health trends more efficiently
* Authorities access real‑time risk and compliance data

### 2. Benefits of the solution

* **Social:** Better farmer awareness and safer food production
* **Economic:** Reduced livestock mortality, increased profits
* **Environmental:** Controlled disease spread reduces environmental contamination
